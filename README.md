__UPDATE__: https://gno.land/r/boards:bounties <-- bounties will be ported there.

# Active Bounties

If you see active bounties on github.com/gnolang/bounties, it is still active!

### 3. Retrospective on CosmosHub software contracts from the ICF and related entities
  * Investigation into case studies (motivated by recent gravity bridge discussions).
  * Proposal for legal clauses to add to software projects funded by such entities.
  * A plan to create an oversign committee funded by the Cosmos Hub.
  * 1000 ATOMs from @jaekwon, but first get approval for plan.
  * Unspecified amount of GNOTs, amount pending plan for general tasks (coming soon).

### 8. BETACOIN for Cosmos
  * STOP, ON HOLD -- WORKING ON #7.
  * Related to bounty #7.
  * See https://nitter.net/jaekwon/status/1501625690549936132#m
  * 4000 ATOMs from @jaekwon
  * Significantly more GNOTs than prior bounties
  * Continued partership with GNO

### 9. Keplr or similar for GNO contracts
  * See https://gno.land/r/boards?funcs for example contract endpoints
  * Significant GNOTs; negotiable.
  * Continued partership with GNO

### 10. Use GO typechecker
  * Rename .go to .gno where appropriate
  * Make gno precompiler (which comes before preprocessor) compile .gno to .go in same folder.
  * "gno.land/r/realm" in .gno becomes "github.com/gnolang/gno/examples/gno.land/r/realm" in .go.
  * "std" becomes "github.com/gnolang/gno/stdlibs/stdshim" (?) 
  * keeps a whitelist of stdlib packages (to prevent attacks, to prevent compiling malware).
  * Precompiler tries to compile the translated .go code using go, before proceeding.
  * Solves this: https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/107
  * 500 ATOMs
  * Significantly more GNOTs than prior bounties

# Completed Bounties

### 1. Get CosmosHub 1,2,3 blockchain data
  * Must upload raw blockchain data to S3 link or similar
  * Link may be private, contact for private transfer (we will publish for public separately)
  * Also coordinate on ION governance telegram chat for updates t.me/IONGovernanceWorkingGroup
  * 1000 OSMO from @jaekwon
  * COMPLETE: sunny referred to [interchain link](https://archive.interchain.io/).
  * [SUMMARY](bounties/001_cosmoshub_blockchain_data/README.md).
  
### 2. Derive governance history using script on CosmosHub 1,2,3,4 data
  * Must share github or gitlab link to script repo
  * Also coordinate on ION governance telegram chat for updates t.me/IONGovernanceWorkingGroup
  * 5000 OSMO from @jaekwon
  * Unspecified amount of GNOTs, amount pending plan for general tasks (coming soon).
  * [SUMMARY](bounties/001_cosmoshub_blockchain_data/README.md).

### 4. Port JOESON to Go
  * github.com/jaekwon/joescript
  * The intent is to create an independent left-recursive PEG parser for Gno.
  * Optional: port Joescript or Javascript.
  * 1000 ATOMs from @jaekwon
  * More GNOTs than from #3.

### 5. Make script for Backup Keys
  * We can't know that there hasn't been a leak of private keys via some unknown mechanism.
  * A large scale theft is almost inconceivable, but possible for all one knows.
  * Such a large scale theft is the only existential risk to cosmos/crypto.
  * Create a simple English document and Go code for the following procedures:
    - create a backup secp256k1 AND ed25519 pubkeys on an airgapped offline computer.
    - use gnokey.
    - use custom entropy (e.g. dice-rolls).
    - ask everyone on Cosmos to publish both backup pubkeys by sending a transaction with memo to a null address bech32(20 zero bytes).
  * Use the same bip39/bip32 construction for the secp256k1 privkey/pubkey.
  * Use only sha256() for the ed25519 privkey/pubkey and an alternative sha256-based KDF function (may need to modify gno/pkgs & gnokey.
  * Include instructions for building this binary from a verified build of Go.
  * 1000 ATOMs from @jaekwon
  * Same number of GNOTs as #4.
  * See https://github.com/gnolang/bounties/issues/15 for discussion on goals.
  * [SUMMARY TODO](XXX). see https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/98; also tallying

### 6. Calculate the delegations of the ICF
  * This is an exercise in keeping public institutions accountable.
  * Use publicly verifiable information to track the current AND historic delegations of the ICF.
  * Any code and data must be well organized, commented, and easy to grok.
  * Create a table of historic and current delegators, and their identities and respective owners.
  * Unspecified number of ATOMs and GNOTs depending on difficulty.
  * [SUMMARY](https://github.com/gnolang/bounties/tree/main/bounties/006_icf_delegations).

### 7. Snapshot fork of the CosmosHub
  * UPDATE: see https://github.com/gnolang/bounties/issues/24#issuecomment-1094298684
  * Genesis distribution from well structured Go code.
  * See https://nitter.net/jaekwon/status/1504231750725083138#m
  * Does not need to use CosmosHub1,2,3; only from CosmosHub4.
  * 2000 ATOMs from @jaekwon
  * Significantly more GNOTs than prior bounties
  * Start negotiation on design spec submission
  * [SUMMARY](https://github.com/gnolang/bounties/tree/main/bounties/007_snapshot_fork).
